# Urbanization and Land Use Analysis using Satellite Imagery

* **Course:** Image Mining (M2 IA, Paris-Saclay)
* **Team:** Thibault Poux, Simon Khan, Feddy Immoula
* **Status:** In Progress

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze urban expansion and land use changes using **Sentinel-1/2 (SAR/optical) and Landsat satellite data**. We focus on detecting and classifying newly artificialized areas (e.g., buildings, roads, parking lots) and comparing the performance of SAR vs. optical imagery for land use monitoring.

### Key Objectives:
- Detect artificialization using **SAR image comparison**.
- Compare results with **optical imagery** at the same locations (precision, computational cost).
- Classify new artificialized areas (e.g., buildings, roads, parking lots).

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Sources
- **Sentinel-1 (SAR):** For change detection in urban areas.
- **Sentinel-2 & Landsat (Optical):** For land cover classification and validation.
- **Dataset:** [Sentinel-1/2 Image Pairs (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/requiemonk/sentinel12-image-pairs-segregated-by-terrain) – pre-segregated SAR/optical pairs for change detection.
